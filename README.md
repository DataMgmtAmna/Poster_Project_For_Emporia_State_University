**Poster_Project_For_Emporia_State_University**

**Abstract:**

Emporia State University (ESU) significantly contributes to the local economy by employing 665 individuals and generating over $36 million in salaries and wages. It attracts numerous non-local students and visitors, enhancing local business through their expenditures. This study aims to quantify ESU's economic impact by analyzing direct, indirect and induced spending effects within the community. Utilizing data from ESU expenditures, visitor and student surveys, and an input-output econometric model developed by IMPLAN, the research will provide insights into the university's economic contributions. This information will support ESU's administration, local and state policymakers, business communities, and residents, enabling better-informed decisions regarding the university's role in the socioeconomic development of Kansas.
